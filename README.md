# Mario-Kart-64-AP-Tracker
This is a Poptracker pack for the Nintendo 64 game Mario Kart 64. It can be connected to an Archipelago server for autotracking.

## Installation
Just download the lastest build or source and put in your packs folder (unpacked).

Currently the tracker can not grab data about settings and course shuffle so to make the tracker work correctly, those information need to be filled in manually.

## Bug Reporting
If you find any bugs in the tracker, feel free to contact me on Discord. If you know how to fix the error yourself, feel free to submit a PR.

## Known Issues
- Settings do not get automatically tracked
- Course shuffle does not not get automatically tracked
- "Destroy Tree" and "Destroy Piranha Plant" locations do not mark as collected when sent to Archipelago
